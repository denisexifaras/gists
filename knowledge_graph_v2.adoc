= Building a Knowledge Graph

anchor:anchor-2[]


== Big Picture Motivation

==== Internal Use

create a reference database of "knowledge" that will map out the themes in digital enlightenment. This is interesting in its own right, for example in order to allow to modularise content for the day course or workshops. An extensive topic database can be used as a reference for creating "bespoke" courses, or for extending/modifying "standard" courses.

==== For an online course

We would like to build an online learning platform with the following attributes:
[loweralpha]
. it will contain all topics for digital enlightenment
. the set of topics that a user will explore will depend on who the user is
. the delivery method (learning experience) will adjust to who the user is

=== Why use one here?

//list
. Intuitive way to think of relationships between topics


. Completely flexbile to accommodate nested relationships


. Allows us to explore/visualise more distant relationships


. Lots of graph theory to help us create ``sensible'' journeys


. This method scales: allows us to build parts of at different times and at different levels of sophistication.

=== Tools

*Neo4j* ``The world's leading Graph Database''
  
  We don't have to use a graph database. We can use document stores and use graph thoery externally. And we will to some extent. But it's still useful: allows us to store properties etc all in one place. Among other things, it will also hold pointers to the actual document stores.
  (so it's more a database of databases)

anchor:anchor-2[]

*Cypher* Graph query language used with Neo4j. 

  If we stick with Neo4j everyone will need to learn cypher...?
  
  As above, it's possible cypher will only be used for basic queries to get some initial output from the database and then a programming language will take over.

anchor:anchor-2[]

Most likely this will be a document store managed e.g. with c++ with neo4j providing a higher level management system.


=== What have we collected?

==== Nodes

>300 topics by looking through all our presentations, table of contents from online books and brainstorming

  Obviously this is not exhaustive but was not meant to be (There are tons of things that I have not included here (for example consider ToC from http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do)) (will revisit this in a sec)!
  
  A node should be anything that we envisage will hold data (information/slides/exercises).

MATCH (n) DELETE n;

(cloud:Thing {name:"Cloud",type:"Object"});

MATCH (n) RETURN n;

----
//graph

==== Edges
  
>1500 connections between them: we create ‘links’ between nodes that are related in a very obvious way.
  
  NOTE: Edges are are added only if two nodes are related in a very obvious way (for example Google Fusion has not been linked to anything). Obviously the more edges the more flexbile the journey through the graph can be, but this has to balance with a sensible number of possible journeys and journey architecture. For example, Google Doc -> Data Store but Google Doc !-> Data. This highlights the importance of looking further away then 1st degree relationships whenever we are exploring the graph.
  
  At this stage, edges are bidirectional and carry equal weight. This will eventually have to be revised...

  *The process of adding edges should be supervised by more than one person....*

== Hierarchy

So we have a topic space. But not all topics have the same importance. For example, computational thinking is should have more weight than JavaScript. There is inherent hierarchy and nesting between our topics. `Data pipeline' is a different thing to `API'.

This should be incorporated because:

//list
[loweralpha]
. For journey management

  Knowledge of `hierarchy' will allow us to create lessons (collections of nodes), for example.
  
  Some special nodes should help us jump around the graph more efficiently (faster navigation)
  
  All this suggests that we can more easily get more information on what could be the different relationships between nodes.

. to inform on type of content and content delivery
  
  e.g. some nodes could just be jargon busters that can just pop-up whenever relevant
  
  e.g. some nodes could represent higher-level overview of big concepts that a user should *always* visit
  
  e.g. some nodes should link to online exercises 


I can think of two ways for handling this.

//list
.Ordered

. Using properties (e.g. (data {name:"Data", importance:10, type:"Major Theme"})

. Using node labels: nodes are no longer the same thing but can represent different types of objects (for example we can have actors, movies and country of origin all represented by nodes in the same graph).

  I have selected this 2nd approach -- this might change!

//graph

=== What are the categories?

* Create a hierarchy of topics/concepts in order to construct the graph and better understand the landscape of digital enlightenment:

  - *Fields* (e.g. Internet)
  

    `Fields' are the main areas that collectively capture all concepts in digital enlightenment. For someone to be
    truly digitally enlightened, they must have sufficiently explored all `Fields'.

         |      Comp. Thinking       |       Data      |      Security      |      Internet       |       Hardware      |

    Fields can only have overview comments (i.e. no exercises) and links to books etc

  - *Themes* (e.g. Web)
    
    `Themes' are higher level concepts but ultimately belong under one or more of the `Fields'. Themes but are too conceptual to be classified as `Topics'.  `Themes' should be well known for us to decide which ones need to be covered/explored.
    
    There can be nesting within Themes. In this case there is `parent_topic' property.
    
    For example: 
    Front-end is a Theme, but it is nested under Web.
    Machine Learning is a Theme, but it is nested under Statistics.
    Unsupervised Machine Learning is a Theme, but it is nested under Machine Learning.
    
    Themes can only have overview comments

  - *Topics* (e.g. html, css) 
  
    The majority of the contents of the knowledge graph are probably going to be topics. These are specific learning items that may also have exercises etc. Just like with Themes, there can be lots of nesting here that can be explicitly incorporated using the parent_topic property.

  - *Tools* (e.g. JS Fiddle) 
  
    Tools should be linked to all other topics, themes etc to which they are relevant. If a tool is online, there should also be a url and an edge to the Web.

  - *Websites* (e.g. Stackoverflow, W3C)
  
    Websites should be linked to all other topics, themes etc to which they are relevant. Websites should also have a url.

  - *People* (e.g. Ada Lovelace, Sir Tim)
  
    All(?) individuals that we refer to in our slides have been included here, and of course more may be added. People have a full name and they are linked to all the topics, themes, fields to which they have contributed.
    
    There are more `voiced' in the resources pages that haven't made it on the graph yet.

  - *Books* (useful books; e.g. HTML5 Cookbook by O'reilly media)
  
    All books should have a url linking to something useful. Ideally we also need an author and publisher.

  - *Cases*/*Definitions* (e.g. Heartbleed, Data Pipeline)
  
    Anything that is a bit too complicated to categorize or to niche has been temporarily set as `Cases'. I have this here because it's in the current version of the graph but ignore it!
    
    (I think we might want to come up with a few more categories as the graph grows and we start adding content)

anchor:anchor-2[]

== What is this Graph?

It's the backbone:

  jQuery ---> Jargon Buster/Overview
              Online notes
              Managing Html
              Forms
              Calendar
              Hover-over
              Drag and Drop
              .......
  All of these should have their own document store, get their own nodes on the graph. Each has its own importance score, weight, difficulty level....
  
  *This gives flexibility for different types of user and different delivery methods and contextualisation*

anchor:anchor-2[]

== Next Steps

anchor:anchor-2[]

A) Add content either on graph or in a different db. Use this niche content to create more meaningful, possible directed relationships!
  
  Different delivery methods for the same thing will have their own respective nodes
  
  We need to have a discussion on node importance/weight and types of edges. 
  
  Weights: how important is it to visit this node? This will depend on the node ``connectivity'' but we can also attach an inherent weight to do with how important we judge it to be for digital enlightenment.
  
  Edges: requires, the same as, identical, similar to, belongs to, collaborates, ....
  
  Edges can have properties too! e.g. the strength of `similar to' and `belongs to'
  
  Putting basic edges in place soon is also important for testing that the graph `reads well'.
  
  Properties: difficulty, ...
  
  Obviously this can be refined later (and indeed we should start basic) but it's good to set up early!
  
  NOTE: all this is still separate from the sorts of things our recommendation engine will consider... We just want to facilitate the work of the recommendation engine so we can have a framework on which we can impose rules

anchor:anchor-2[]

B) Use existing Decoded content to start with? (16 steps, slides,...?)

anchor:anchor-2[]

C) Which parts of the graph and to what depth?

  We can have a light version everywhere (and then start testing an algorithm sooner, e.g. a Markov Chain) OR pick one subsection of the graph and add more advanced content, test links to external material etc sooner.

anchor:anchor-2[]

== Also...

anchor:anchor-2[]

A) Servers

anchor:anchor-2[]

B) *Themes* and *group exercises*

  Themes provide context for all the exercises. The same exercise/slide but in the context of a different theme would occupy a different node. The Theme can be a node property.
  For example: (knn_exercise {name:"KNNs", theme:"Movie", difficulty:5,  weight:1, centrality:1})
  
  Exercises (e.g. building an app that monitors geolocation...) can be linked to (and then assume knowledge of) multiple links in the graph. 
  (this suggests we might end up having more node labels... This will be a very complex object!)

anchor:anchor-2[]

C) Where are the slides etc?

anchor:anchor-2[]

D) Building an API: who will access, when and how?

anchor:anchor-2[]

E) Queryability: brainstorm types of questions we want to ask the graph 

  Like the examples above. This test whether the graph architecture accommodates the types of functions that we want it for.

anchor:anchor-2[]

F) Not an issue yet, but eventually, we will need to ask questions like: what is an achievement? when has on learnt ``enough'' on a certain topic? Etc..
