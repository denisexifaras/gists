= Building a Knowledge Graph

== Why a Knowledge Graph?

There are two main motivations.

First, we would like to be create a reference database of "knowledge" that will map out the themes in digital enlightenment. This is interesting in its own right, for example in order to allow to modularise content for the day course or workshops. An extensive topic database can be used as a reference for creating "bespoke" courses, or for extending/modifying "standard" courses.

Second, we want to build an online learning platform with the following attributes:
//list
[loweralpha]
. it will contain all topics for digital enlightenment
. the set of topics that a user will explore will depend on who the user is
. the delivery method (learning experience) will adjust to who the user is

A topic database will provide the framework upon which online courses can be based.

CAVEAT: We want the journey through the space of topics to be flexible. Hurrah! Use a graph!

//graph

=== Why is it useful?

//list
. Easy to explore relationships between topics (visually)
. Natural way for mapping out relationships between topics
. Graph theory to help us pick journeys though digital enlightenment

== Strategy/Approach

=== The tools

We can use the Neo4j technology and the cypher language (graph query language) to create and explore the knowledge graph. 
Neo4j has paid-for services but so far I've been using the free tools locally on my machine. All scripts are uploaded 
on my decoded google drive. We should discuss moving that to a decoded github folder.

=== Defining the topic space
//list

* Obtain a list of topics looking through all our presentations and table of contents from online books
anchor:anchor-2[]

* Identify common themes and fields to obtain a higher level view of what digital enlightenment is about.
anchor:anchor-2[]

* Create a hierarchy of topics/concepts in order to construct the graph and better understand the landscape of digital enlightenment:
  - *Fields* 
  

    `Fields' are the main areas that collectively capture all concepts in digital enlightenment. For someone to be
    truly digitally enlightened, they must have sufficiently explored all `Fields'.

         |      Comp. Thinking       |       Data      |      Security      |      Web       |       Hardware      |

  - *Themes*,  *SubThemes* & *SubSubThemes*
    
    `Themes' are higher level concepts but ultimately belong under one or more of the `Fields'. `SubThemes' (and SubSubThemes and so on...) are not broad enough to be Themes but are too conceptual to be classified as `Topics'.  `Themes', SubThemes and
    so on should be well known for us to decide which ones need to be covered/explored.
    
    An example: 
    Themes {Coding, Analytics} 
    SubThemes {Statistics, Machine Learning} 
    SubSubTheme {Machine Learning: Unsupervise}

  - *Topics* (e.g. HTML5) + *SubTopics* (e.g. SVG)
  
    The majority of the contents of the knowledge graph are probably going to be topics. These are specific learning items that may also have exercises etc. Subtopics allow us to nest topics if this is meaningful and useful.

  - *Tools* (e.g. Google charts) 
  
    Tools should be linked to all other topics, themes etc to which they are relevant. If a tool is online, there should also be a url.

  - *Websites* (e.g. Stackoverflow)
  
    Websites should be linked to all other topics, themes etc to which they are relevant. Websites should also have a url.

  - *People* (e.g. Ada Lovelace)
  
    All(?) individuals that we refer to in our slides have been included here, and of course more may be added. People have a full name and they are linked to all the topics, themes, fields to which they have contributed.

  - *Books* (useful books; e.g. HTML5 Cookbook by O'reilly media)
  
    All books should have a url linking to something useful. Ideally we also need an author and publisher.

  - *Cases* (topics that are hard to categorize)
  
    Anything that is a bit too complicated to categorize is set as `Cases' -- for example something that could be a SubTopic of several topics. In principle this should change and allow nesting within multiple categories but my cypher is not good enough. Current examples of cases include: Pearson's chi-squared test, Timeseries and many others. Essentially `Cases' can also be Topics but it's simpler to have them as separate whenever an algorithm will look at hierarchy.

== Creating a graph

=== Collecting Nodes

*Add a node to the graph for each of the categories above*

  A node should be anything that we envisage will hold data (information/slides/exercises). This can be anything from a field to a case. There are tons of things that I have not included here (for example consider ToC from http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do) -- we should discuss the level of detail that this should have. For example should 'booleans' have their own node?

  *The process of categorization/classification of nodes should be supervised by more than one person...*
  
//hidden
[source,cypher]
----

CREATE 

(undata:Website {name:"UN Data", url:"http://data.un.org/"}),

(google_fusion:Tools {name:"Google Fusion Tables", url:"https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232"}),

(input:Topic {name:"Input"}),

(servers:Topic {name:"Servers"});

MATCH (n)
WHERE n:Website OR n:Tools OR n.name = "Servers" OR n.name = "Input" OR n:Topic
RETURN n;

----
//graph_results

=== Adding Edges

*Create `links' between nodes that are related in a very obvious way.* 

  Edges demonstrate the relationship between nodes. If two nodes are related then they have an edge that connects them.

  At this stage, edges are bidirectional and carry equal weight. This will eventually have to be revised... for example, some relationships are stronger than others (e.g. html with html5 vs xml and file formats)
  
[source,cypher]
----

MATCH (data {name:"Data"}), (servers {name:"Servers"}), (input {name:"Input"}), (cloud {name:"Cloud"}), (undata {name:"UN Data"})
CREATE (data)-[:related]->(input)
CREATE (data)<-[:related]-(input)
CREATE (servers)-[:related]->(cloud)
CREATE (servers)<-[:related]-(cloud)
CREATE (undata)-[:related]->(data)
CREATE (undata)<-[:related]-(data);

----
//graph

  NOTE: Edges are are added only if two nodes are related in a very obvious way (for example Google Fusion has not been linked to anything). Obviously the more edges the more flexbile the journey through the graph can be, but this has to balance with a sensible number of possible journeys and journey architecture. For example, Google Doc -> Data Store but Google Doc !-> Data. This highlights the importance of looking further away then 1st degree relationships whenever we are exploring the graph.
  
  *The process of adding edges should be supervised by more than one person....*

=== An example - why we should explore distant graph relationships

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a {name:"JavaScript"})-[r:related]->(a2 {name:"Data"})
RETURN a,a2 as node;
----
JavaScript is not very obviously a language that is associated with `Data'. We should therefore not have any edges 
between them, and indeed the result is NULL:

//table

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a {name:"JavaScript"})-[r:related]->(b)-[q:related]->(a2 {name:"Data"})
RETURN a,b,a2;
----

However, jQuery is very obviously associated both with JavaScript and with Data. Whenever we don't limit ourselves to
just first-degree relationships, we start seeing the relationship between two topics within a wider context:

//graph_result

Let's consider some examples from the real database!

anchor:anchor-2[]

What is "Data" directly related to?

image::http://s25.postimg.org/8p0kglg8v/data_1d.png[]
anchor:anchor-2[]

And "Security"?

image::http://s25.postimg.org/g7jpp87lr/security_1d.png[]

anchor:anchor-2[]

There doesn't seem to be that much overlap... But what about the wider neighbourhood around Security? If we look at all
nodes that are separated by at most 2-degrees, there are more than 800 results and 2000 relationships! So, for the sake
of visualisation, look just at the themes and subthemes:

anchor:anchor-2[]

The graph allows us to see relationships, themes and patterns between topics that might have normally seemed unrelated...

anchor:anchor-2[]
It also shows us possible journeys throught the space of digital enlightenment. 
anchor:anchor-2[]

However, the graph may also be a useful resouce for decoded internally. For example, what are all the individuals
that we refer to?

image::http://s25.postimg.org/80jhwgd4v/people.png[]

And which of these are related to HMTL5?

image::http://s25.postimg.org/e2r4my1kv/people_html5.png[]

== Where are we?

//list
. List of topics (212 and counting)
  .. The list of topics is not exhaustive (and I'm not sure yet whether we want it to be) 

  Shall we try and look at them all from the real data base?

. Just under 4300 relationships between them
