= Building a Knowledge Graph

We want to build an online learning platform with the following attributes:
//list
[loweralpha]
. it will contain all topics for digital enlightenment
. the set of topics that a user will explore will depend on who the user is
. the delivery method (learning experience) will adjust to who the user is

CAVEAT: We want the journey through the space of topics to be flexible. Hurrah! Use a graph!

//Fields
(ct:Field {name:"Comp. Thinking"}),
(data:Field {name:"Data"}),
(web:Field {name:"Web"}),

(html:Topic {name:"html"}),
(html)-[:RT]->(web),

(js)-[:RT]->(web),
(js)-[:RT]->(ct),

(python:Topic {name:"Python"}),
(python)-[:RT]->(data),
(python)-[:RT]->(ct),

(cloud:Topic {name:"Cloud"}),
(cloud)-[:RT]->(data),
(cloud)-[:RT]->(web),

MATCH n RETURN n as node;

//graph
