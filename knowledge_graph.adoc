= Building a Knowledge Graph

We want to build an online learning platform with the following attributes:
//list
[loweralpha]
. it will contain all topics for digital enlightenment
. the set of topics that a user will explore will depend on who the user is
. the delivery method (learning experience) will adjust to who the user is

CAVEAT: We want the journey through the space of topics to be flexible. Hurrah! Use a graph!
