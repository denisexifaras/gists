= Building a Knowledge Graph

== Why a Knowledge Graph?

There are two main motivations.

First, we would like to be create a reference database of "knowledge" that will map out the themes in digital enlightenment. This is interesting in its own right, for example in order to allow to modularise content for the day course or workshops. An extensive topic database can be used as a reference for creating "bespoke" courses, or for extending/modifying "standard" courses.

Second, we want to build an online learning platform with the following attributes:
//list
[loweralpha]
. it will contain all topics for digital enlightenment
. the set of topics that a user will explore will depend on who the user is
. the delivery method (learning experience) will adjust to who the user is

A topic database will provide the framework upon which online courses can be based.

CAVEAT: We want the journey through the space of topics to be flexible. Hurrah! Use a graph!

//graph

=== Why is it useful?

//list
. Easy to explore relationships between topics (visually)
. Natural way for mapping out relationships between topics
. Graph theory to help us pick journeys though digital enlightenment

== Strategy/Approach

=== The tools

We can use the Neo4j technology and the cypher language (graph query language) to create and explore the knowledge graph. 
Neo4j has paid-for services but so far I've been using the free tools locally on my machine. All scripts are uploaded 
on my decoded google drive. We should discuss moving that to a decoded github folder.

=== Creating the topic space
//list
.Bulleted
* Obtain a list of topics looking through all our presentations and table of contents from online books
* Identify common themes and fields to obtain a higher level view of what digital enlightenment is about.
* Create a hierarchy of topics/concepts in order to construct the graph and better understand the landscape of digital enlightenment:
  - Fields (Computational Thinking, Data, Security, Web, Hardware)
  - Themes (e.g. Coding, Analytics) & SubThemes (e.g. Statistics, Machine Learning) & SubSubTheme (e.g. Machine Learning: Unsupervised)
  - Topics (e.g. HTML5) + SubTopics (e.g. SVG)
  - ``Cases'' (topics that are hard to categorize)
* Add a node to the graph for each of the above
* Create `links' between nodes that are related in a very obvious way.


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a {name:"JavaScript"})-[r:related]->(a2 {name:"Data"})
RETURN a,a2 as node;
----
//graph_result

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a {name:"JavaScript"})-[r:related]->(b)-[q:related]->(a2 {name:"Data"})
RETURN a,b,a2;
----
//graph_result

//table

== Test?
//list
. List of topics (212 and counting)
. Just under 4300 relationships between them
